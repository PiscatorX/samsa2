# SAMSA2-nf: a nextflow implementation of the samsa2 metatranscriptome analysis pipeline

*****
For more information about  samsa2 please visit the repository (<https://github.com/transcript/samsa2>)  with the original samsa2 implementation.

The approach of the SAMSA2 pipeline was followed in the implementation of the  pipeline. The pipeline has been implemented in nexflow instead of shell scripting. Not all functions have been implicated.
